This branch is a side project that:
* Uses Gemini to analyze all the files in a Google Drive and assign them relevant tags
* Sorts files in a Drive according to: Year Created, Month Created, Tag Assigned (you can choose between MOVING files into a sorted folder, or Copying files into a sorted folder)

## IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:
# This program will require you to create a Google Cloud project, as well as a Google Gemini API key. 

This program relies on the Drive API to retrieve files and manage their metadata. It also uses the Gemini API to analyze the files. It requires a Google Cloud project to be created.
