## Project Overview
We created an AI chat app like ChatGPT and Gemini except it has acess to an entire Google Drive's worth of knowledge. The chat bot will know where each file is and what it's about so that it can use the relative context to make informed responses.  

We also created a drive tagger desktop app that uses Gemini to analyze all the files in a Google Drive, assign them relevant tags, and sorts files in the Drive according to: Year Created, Month Created, Tag Assigned.

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: Next JS, Tailwind CSS 
- Backend: Next JS API Routes/Server Actions
- Database: Convex
- APIs: Google OAuth, Ragie

## Getting Started
This is how you run the AI Chat app:

```bash
git clone Neural-Nexus-HeritageSquareFounda
cd Neural-Nexus-HeritageSquareFounda/square-ai
bun install
bun run dev
```

GO to the drive tagger branch on the repo to learn how to run the drive tagger app!
